Classes of IP Addresses:
========================
- There are 5 classes of IP addresses: Class A, B, C, D and E.
- Each class has a range of valid IP addresses.
- The value of first octet determines the class which belongs to?
- IP addresses from Class(A,B,C) can be used for host IP address.
- Class D IP addresses used for multicast.
- Class E for experimental purposes.

How these classes are formed?
=============================
- The classes are created depending on the network size.
- For ex :  If you have a setup where many hosts but less networks then class A IP addresses are used.
		    If you have a setup where less hosts but lot(numerous) of networks then class C IP addresses are used.
		   
Classes:
========
class		range	Subnet mask 
Class A   	0-127		8
Class B   	128-191		16
Class C   	192-223		24
Class D   	224-239		-
Class E   	240-255		-


- For the IP addresses from class A, the first 8bits(first decimal number) represent the network part, 
	whiile the remaining 24 bits represent the host part.
	
- For Class B, the first 16 bits (the first two numbers) represent the network part, 
	while the remaining 16 bits represent the host part. 

- For Class C, the first 24 bits represent the network part, while the remaining 8 bits represent the host part.


NOTE: This system of network address via classes are bypassed today by use of the "classless Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR)" addressing.


Special IP address ranges that are used for special purposes are:
=================================================================
	0.0.0.0/8 – addresses used to communicate with the local network
	127.0.0.0/8 – loopback addresses
	169.254.0.0/16 – link-local addresses (APIPA)
