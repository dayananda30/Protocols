Trace-Route:
============
- Traceroute is a commandline interface tool used to identify the path used to identify the path used by a packet to reach its target.
- Uses ICMP messages, traceroute sends a series of ICMP echo request packets to a destination.
- First series of messages, TTL(Time To Live) is set to 1, which means that the first router in a path will discard the packet and an ICMP Time Exceeding message.
- TTL : which is the number of routers(hops) it can pass through before the packet is discarded.
- It uses UDP packets with a large destination port number(33434 to 33534) that is unlikely to be used by any application at the destination host.
- How it Works:
- Step 1 : Trace-Route works by setting the TTL for a packet to 1, sending it towards the requested destination host and listening for the reply.
- Step 2 : When the initiating machine receives a "time exceeded" response, it examines the packet to determine wherer the packet came from.
- Step 3 : Then the tracing machine generates a new packet with TTL 2 and so on.

Why three columns for time in the output?
=========================================
Trace-Route sends out three packets per TTL increment. Each column corresponds to the time took to get one packet back(round-trip-time).
The number in milli seconds is the network latency between you and the hop.
